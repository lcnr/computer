# Rock Emulator

An emulator for the given computer.
As every command of the computer requires the same amount of time,
this emulator can be used to accurately simulate an actual process.

## Restrictions

Unlike the actual computer, this emulator panics on integer over- and underflows,
to detect errors in the implementation of the [boulder](../boulder/README.md) compiler.
